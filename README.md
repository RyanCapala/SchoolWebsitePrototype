# SchoolWebsitePrototype

Project overview, purpose, and motivation:
The project is a replacement for the current MyUNLV system. The purpose is to provide a user friendly system that is easy to use and visually appealing. The motivation for deciding to take on this project is that we feel that the current MyUNLV system is outdated and in need of upgrades. 

This site was built using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap4. 

Future work would involve further development of the Student user role to include all current pages deemed necessary. Additional user roles would also be developed via an extensive usability and feature analysis of each specific user group. Further UX improvements and optimizations to improve the performance and safety of the interface would be implemented. API access for integration with payroll, Educational platforms, Enterprise Resource Planning among others.
